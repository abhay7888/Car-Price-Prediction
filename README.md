🚗 Car Price Prediction
📌 Overview
Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project that estimates the selling price of a car based on its features such as model year, engine type, fuel type, and more. The goal is to help users determine a fair resale value using data-driven insights.

🧠 Problem Statement
Car buyers and sellers often struggle to estimate a car's fair market value. This project uses regression models to accurately predict the car price based on historical data, making the resale process smarter and more efficient.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

Techniques: Linear Regression, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization

🗃️ Dataset
Used a car dataset (Kaggle or custom) containing features like:

Year

Selling Price

Present Price

Kms Driven

Fuel Type

Seller Type

Transmission

Owner

📈 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training using Linear Regression

Model evaluation (R² Score, MAE)

Visualization of insights and predictions

🏁 How to Run
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abhay7888/D.A.PROJECT.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook
Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb

Run all cells step-by-step to see data analysis, model building, and predictions

📊 Output Sample
Actual vs Predicted Price comparison

R² Score: ~0.89 (example, replace with actual score)

Visualization of price trends and model accuracy

🔮 Future Improvements
Integrate with a web frontend (e.g., Flask app)

Use advanced algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Add more features like brand, region, or condition
