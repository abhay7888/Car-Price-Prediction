##🚗 Car Price Prediction – Project Summary <BR>
📌 Objective: Predict the selling price of a car using machine learning based on factors like year, fuel type, and engine type.

📊 Problem Solved: Helps users estimate a fair resale value of cars using data-driven predictions.

🧠 ML Technique: Implemented Linear Regression for prediction with proper model evaluation (R² Score, MAE).

🧰 Technologies Used:

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

📁 Dataset Features: Year, Present Price, Kms Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, Owner

📈 Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training and performance visualization

Price prediction and accuracy check

🔎 Highlights:

Achieved high model accuracy (e.g., R² ≈ 0.89)

Plotted actual vs predicted price for model validation

🚀 Future Scope:

Upgrade to advanced models like Random Forest

Deploy using Flask or Streamlit for live web prediction

Enhance dataset with brand, condition, and location
